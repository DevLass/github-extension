<h3 align="justify"> <i>It's already the second extension I make here and in this one, I brought some news, such as the direct alteration of third-party pages. <br> <br> Just on my GitHub page it changes my profile picture, its border-radius, adds a hover for some buttons, add more details to my bio, and mostly adds a button that translates the whole main page to Portuguese. And mainly he change the number of stars to 10000000!</i> </h3>
